Hash Tables
This project contains C tasks for learning about the hash table data structure.

Tasks To Complete
 0. >>> ht = {}
0-hash_table_create.c contains a function that creates a hash table.
 1. djb2
1-djb2.c contains a hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm.
 2. key -> index
2-key_index.c contains a function that gives you the index of a key.
 3. >>> ht['betty'] = 'cool'
3-hash_table_set.c contains a function that adds an element to the hash table.
 4. >>> ht['betty']
4-hash_table_get.c contains a function that retrieves a value associated with a key.
 5. >>> print(ht)
5-hash_table_print.c contains a function that prints a hash table.
 6. >>> del ht
6-hash_table_delete.c contains a function that deletes a hash table.
 7. $ht['Betty'] = 'Cool'
100-sorted_hash_table.c contains rewrites of the previous functions that create a sorted hash table.
